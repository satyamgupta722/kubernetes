To apply labels to existing pods -

- Kubectl label pods <podname> env=dev (labels key=value)
- Kubectl get pods --show-labels
- kubectl get pods -l env=dev (To list pods with matching labels) , kubectl get pods -l env!=dev (selector to show env is not dev pods)
- kubectl get pods -l 'env in (test,dev)' (Setbased selectors) (in, notin, exists) ---- set based


Node Selector - 

Schedule a pod to run on a particular node. We tell pod to run on a particular nodes. 
- equality based and set based selector 
Ex- nodeSelector:
         hardware: t2-medium
